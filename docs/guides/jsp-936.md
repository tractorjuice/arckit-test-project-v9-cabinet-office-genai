# JSP 936 AI Assurance Guide

`/arckit.jsp-936` provides MOD Dependable AI (JSP 936) documentation for defence AI systems. Use it to evidence the five ethical principles, lifecycle coverage, and approval pathway.

## Before You Run

| Artefact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Requirements & architecture | Identify AI components, data flows, and human interaction |
| Risk register & security assessment | Seed ethical and safety risks |
| Data model & DPIA | Map personal/special category data |
| Governance roles | Confirm RAISO, Ethics Manager, project lead |

---

## Command

```bash
/arckit.jsp-936 Generate JSP 936 assurance for <AI system>
```

Output: `projects/<id>/ARC-<id>-JSP936-v1.0.md`

## Assessment Structure

| Section | Focus | Key Evidence |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| Risk Classification | Likelihood × impact (Critical → Minor) | Score triggers approval path (2PUS, Defence-level, TLB) |
| Ethical Principles | Human-centricity, Responsibility, Understanding, Bias & Harm, Reliability | Actions and mitigations per principle |
| Lifecycle Phases | Planning → Quality Assurance (8 phases) | Evidence across planning, build, testing, deployment, monitoring |
| Governance | Roles, sign-off, battle rhythm | RAISO, Ethics Manager, assurance board dates |
| Continuous Monitoring | Drift detection, retraining policy, incident response | Links to `/arckit.servicenow` and ops runbooks |

---

## Review Playbook

1. Validate risk classification and approval route with programme governance.
2. Confirm human-in-the-loop controls and escalation paths.
3. Check bias and harm mitigations include test coverage and ethical sign-off.
4. Ensure supplier assurance (if third-party AI) is documented.
5. Log required actions in backlog with owners and dates.

## Update Cadence

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| New AI capability or model retraining | Re-run `/arckit.jsp-936` and update evidence |
| Risk classification change | Notify RAISO/Ethics board; revisit approval pathway |
| Annual assurance review | Refresh assessment; confirm monitoring data |
