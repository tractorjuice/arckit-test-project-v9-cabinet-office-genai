Create federated data product contracts for mesh architectures with SLAs, governance, and interoperability guarantees (project)
"""
prompt = """
You are helping an enterprise architect **create a data mesh contract** for a data product in a federated mesh architecture.

This command generates a **data-mesh-contract** document that defines the formal agreement between a data product provider (domain team) and consumers, following the **Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS) v3.0.2**.

## User Input
```text
{{args}}
```

## Instructions

### Step 0: Check Prerequisites

**IMPORTANT**: Before generating a data mesh contract, verify that foundational artifacts exist:

1. **Architecture Principles** (REQUIRED):
   - Check if `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` exists
   - If it does NOT exist:
     ```
     ❌ Architecture principles not found.

     Data mesh contracts require architecture principles to be established first.
     Principles should include mesh governance standards (federated ownership, data as a product, self-serve infrastructure).

     Please run: /arckit.principles Create enterprise architecture principles

     Then return here to generate the data mesh contract.
     ```
   - If it exists, proceed to Step 1

2. **Data Model** (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED):
   - Check if the project has a `ARC-*-DATA-*.md` file
   - If it does NOT exist:
     ```
     ⚠️  Warning: No data model found for this project.

     Data mesh contracts are typically derived from existing data models (entities become data products).

     Consider running: /arckit.data-model Create data model for [project name]

     You can proceed without a data model, but you'll need to define schema from scratch.

     Continue anyway? (yes/no)
     ```
   - If user says \"no\", stop here and tell them to run `/arckit.data-model` first
   - If user says \"yes\" or if ARC-*-DATA-*.md exists, proceed to Step 1

3. **Stakeholder Analysis** (RECOMMENDED):
   - Check if the project has `ARC-*-STKE-*.md`
   - If it does NOT exist:
     ```
     ⚠️  Warning: No stakeholder analysis found.

     Stakeholder analysis helps identify:
     - Domain owners (who owns this data product)
     - Consumers (who will use this data product)
     - Data stewards and governance stakeholders

     Consider running: /arckit.stakeholders Analyze stakeholders for [project name]

     You can proceed without stakeholder analysis, but ownership roles will be generic placeholders.

     Continue anyway? (yes/no)
     ```
   - If user says \"no\", stop here
   - If user says \"yes\" or if ARC-*-STKE-*.md exists, proceed to Step 1

### Step 1: Parse User Input

Extract the **data product name** from the user's message. Examples:
- \"Create contract for customer payments\"
- \"Generate mesh contract for seller analytics data product\"
- \"customer-orders contract\"

The data product name should be:
- Kebab-case: `customer-payments`, `seller-analytics`
- Descriptive of the business domain

If the user didn't provide a clear data product name, ask:
```
What is the name of the data product for this contract?

Examples:
- customer-payments
- seller-analytics
- order-events
- fraud-detection-features

Data product name (kebab-case):
```

### Step 2: Find or Create Project

Use the `create-project.sh` script to find or create the project directory:

```bash
bash .arckit/scripts/bash/create-project.sh \\
  --name \"$DATA_PRODUCT_NAME\" \\
  --json
```

**Parse the JSON output** to get:
- `project_id` (e.g., 001, 002)
- `project_path` (e.g., `projects/001-customer-payments/`)
- `project_name` (e.g., `customer-payments`)

**Important**: If the script creates a NEW project, inform the user:
```
✅ Created new project: Project {project_id} - {project_name}
   Location: {project_path}

Note: This is a new project. You may want to run these commands first:
- /arckit.stakeholders - Identify domain owners and consumers
- /arckit.data-model - Define entities that become data products
- /arckit.requirements - Capture DR-xxx data requirements
```

If the project ALREADY EXISTS, just acknowledge it:
```
📂 Using existing project: Project {project_id} - {project_name}
   Location: {project_path}
```

### Step 3: Create Contract Directory

Data mesh contracts should be organized in a subdirectory:

```bash
mkdir -p {project_path}/data-mesh-contracts
```

The contract file will use the multi-instance naming pattern:
```
{project_path}/data-mesh-contracts/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-DMC-{NNN}-v1.0.md
```

Where `{NNN}` is the next sequential number for contracts in this project. Use the script with `--next-num` flag:
```bash
bash .arckit/scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh {project_id} DMC 1.0 --filename --next-num
```

### Step 4: Read the Template

Read the data mesh contract template:

```bash
cat .arckit/templates/data-mesh-contract-template.md

   > **Note**: Read the `VERSION` file and update the version in the template metadata line when generating.
```

### Step 4b: Check for External Documents (optional)

Scan for external (non-ArcKit) documents the user may have provided:

**Existing Data Contracts & SLA Documents**:
- **Look in**: `projects/{project-dir}/external/`
- **File types**: PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), JSON (.json)
- **What to extract**: Existing data product definitions, SLA terms, schema specifications, data quality rules
- **Examples**: `data-contract-v1.yml`, `data-sla.pdf`, `schema-registry.json`

**User prompt**: If no external data contract docs found but they would improve the output, ask:
\"Do you have any existing data contracts, data product SLAs, or schema specifications? I can read PDFs, YAML, and JSON files directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip.\"

**Important**: This command works without external documents. They enhance output quality but are never blocking.

### Step 5: Gather Context from Existing Artifacts

**IF `ARC-*-DATA-*.md` exists in the project**:
- Read `{project_path}/ARC-*-DATA-*.md`
- Extract:
  - Entity definitions (these become Objects in the contract)
  - Attributes (these become Properties)
  - PII markings
  - Data classifications
  - Relationships

**IF `ARC-*-REQ-*.md` exists**:
- Read `{project_path}/ARC-*-REQ-*.md`
- Extract:
  - DR-xxx data requirements (these inform schema and quality rules)
  - NFR-P-xxx performance requirements (these become SLA targets)
  - NFR-A-xxx availability requirements (these become SLA uptime targets)
  - INT-xxx integration requirements (these become access methods)

**IF `ARC-*-STKE-*.md` exists**:
- Read `{project_path}/ARC-*-STKE-*.md`
- Extract:
  - Stakeholder names and roles (these become ownership roles: Product Owner, Data Steward)
  - Consumer stakeholders (these inform consumer obligations)

**IF `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` exists**:
- Read it to understand mesh governance standards
- Look for principles about:
  - Federated ownership
  - Data as a product
  - Self-serve infrastructure
  - Computational governance
  - UK Government compliance (TCoP, GDPR)

### Step 6: Generate the Data Mesh Contract

Using the template and context gathered, generate a comprehensive data mesh contract.

**Key Sections to Populate**:

1. **Document Information**:
   - Document ID: `ARC-{project_id}-DMC-{NNN}-v1.0` (multi-instance type, uses sequential numbering)

### Step 7: Generate Document ID

Use the `generate-document-id.sh` script with `--next-num` to get the next sequential contract number:

```bash
# Generate document ID with next sequential number
bash .arckit/scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh {project_id} DMC 1.0 --next-num

# Generate filename with next sequential number
bash .arckit/scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh {project_id} DMC 1.0 --filename --next-num
```

This will generate IDs like:
- First contract: `ARC-{project_id}-DMC-001-v1.0` (filename: `ARC-001-DMC-001-v1.0.md`)
- Second contract: `ARC-{project_id}-DMC-002-v1.0` (filename: `ARC-001-DMC-002-v1.0.md`)

Replace `{document_id}` placeholder in the document with this value.

### Step 8: Write the Contract File

**IMPORTANT**: Use the **Write tool** to create the file. Do NOT output the full document content to the user (it will be 2000-4000 lines and exceed token limits).

```
Write tool:
  file_path: {project_path}/data-mesh-contracts/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-DMC-{NNN}-v1.0.md
  content: {full contract content}
```

Note: Use the filename returned by `generate-document-id.sh --filename --next-num` for the actual path.

### Step 9: Show Summary to User

After writing the file, show the user a concise summary (do NOT show the full document):

```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review Contract**: Open the file and customize placeholders ({...})
2. **Domain Team Review**: Product Owner should review all sections
3. **DPO Review** (if PII): Ensure GDPR compliance is accurate
4. **Security Review**: Validate encryption and access controls
5. **Publish to Catalogue**: Register contract in data catalogue for discovery
6. **Consumer Onboarding**: Set up sandbox environment for consumers to test

## Related Commands

- `/arckit.traceability` - Link this contract to requirements and consumers
- `/arckit.analyze` - Score contract completeness and governance quality
- `/arckit.dpia` - Generate Data Protection Impact Assessment (if PII present)

**Full contract**: `{project_path}/data-mesh-contracts/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-DMC-{NNN}-v1.0.md` ({line_count} lines)
```

### Step 10: Post-Generation Recommendations

Based on what artifacts exist, recommend next steps:

**If no ARC-*-REQ-*.md**:
```
💡 Tip: Run /arckit.requirements to capture DR-xxx data requirements.
   These will inform SLA targets and quality rules in future contract updates.
```

**If no ARC-*-STKE-*.md**:
```
💡 Tip: Run /arckit.stakeholders to identify domain owners and consumers.
   This will help assign real names to ownership roles instead of placeholders.
```

**If PII exists but no ARC-*-DPIA-*.md**:
```
⚠️  This contract contains PII ({N} fields marked as PII).

UK GDPR Article 35 may require a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).

Consider running: /arckit.dpia Generate DPIA for {project_name}
```

**If this is a UK Government project**:
```
💡 UK Government Alignment:
   - Technology Code of Practice: Point 8 (Share, reuse and collaborate) ✅
   - National Data Strategy: Pillar 1 (Unlocking value) ✅
   - Data Quality Framework: 5 dimensions covered ✅

Consider running:
   - /arckit.tcop - Technology Code of Practice assessment
   - /arckit.service-assessment - GDS Service Standard (if digital service)
```

## Important Notes

1. **Token Limit Handling**: ALWAYS use the Write tool for the full document. NEVER output the complete contract to the user (it's 2000-4000 lines). Only show the summary.

2. **ODCS Compliance**: This contract follows Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS) v3.0.2. The Appendix A contains a YAML export that can be consumed programmatically.

3. **UK Government Context**: If this is a UK Government project, ensure:
   - Data stored in UK (London region)
   - UK GDPR compliance
   - Technology Code of Practice alignment
   - National Data Strategy alignment
   - Data Quality Framework coverage

4. **Traceability**: The contract links to:
   - Source data model (entities → objects)
   - Requirements (DR-xxx → quality rules, NFR-xxx → SLAs)
   - Stakeholders (→ ownership roles)
   - Architecture principles (→ governance standards)

5. **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
   - MAJOR: Breaking changes (remove field, change type)
   - MINOR: Backward-compatible additions (new field, new object)
   - PATCH: Bug fixes (data quality fixes, documentation)

6. **Federated Ownership**: The domain team owns this contract end-to-end. They are responsible for:
   - SLA adherence
   - Quality monitoring
   - Consumer support
   - Schema evolution
   - Change management

7. **One Contract Per Product**: Don't bundle unrelated datasets. Each domain data product should have its own contract.

8. **Automation is Critical**: The contract is meaningless without observability and automated policy enforcement. Ensure:
   - Quality rules are executable by data quality engines
   - SLA metrics are monitored in real-time
   - Access controls are enforced via API gateway
   - Audit logs are captured automatically

## Example User Interactions

  - Recommends running /arckit.data-model first
```

**Example 3: Contract with full context**
```
User: /arckit.data-mesh-contract fraud-detection-features
Assistant:
  - Checks prerequisites ✅
  - Finds ARC-*-DATA-*.md, ARC-*-REQ-*.md, ARC-*-STKE-*.md
  - Maps entities → objects
  - Maps DR-xxx → quality rules
  - Maps NFR-P-xxx → SLA response time targets
  - Maps stakeholders → ownership roles
  - Generates comprehensive contract with minimal placeholders
  - Shows summary
```

## Error Handling

**If architecture principles don't exist**:
- Stop and tell user to run `/arckit.principles` first
- Do NOT proceed without principles

**If user provides unclear data product name**:
- Ask for clarification: \"What is the name of the data product?\"
- Suggest examples: customer-payments, seller-analytics, order-events

**If project creation fails**:
- Show error message from create-project.sh
- Ask user to check permissions or directory structure

**If template file is missing**:
- Error: \"Template not found: .arckit/templates/data-mesh-contract-template.md\"
- Ask user to check ArcKit installation

**If file write fails**:
- Show error message
- Check if directory exists
- Check permissions
