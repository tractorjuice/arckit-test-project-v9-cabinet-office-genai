Generate Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS) procurement documentation for UK Digital Marketplace
"""
prompt = """
You are helping an enterprise architect prepare Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS) procurement documentation for the UK Digital Marketplace.

## User Input

```text
{{args}}
```

## Context

**Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS)** is the UK Digital Marketplace framework for:
- Custom software development
- Hiring developers, architects, designers, and technical specialists
- Delivering specific digital project outcomes

This command generates DOS-compliant procurement documentation from your existing arc-kit project requirements.

## Instructions

### 0. Read the Template

**Read the template** (with user override support):
- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates-custom/dos-requirements-template.md` exists (user override)
- **If found**: Read the user's customized template
- **If not found**: Read `.arckit/templates/dos-requirements-template.md` (default)

> **Note**: Read the `VERSION` file and update the version in the template metadata line when generating.
> **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit.customize dos`

### 1. Read Available Documents

Scan the project directory for existing artifacts and read them to inform this document:

**MANDATORY** (warn if missing):
- `ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` in `projects/000-global/` — Architecture principles
  - Extract: Technology standards, governance constraints for vendor proposals
  - If missing: ERROR — run `/arckit.principles` first to define governance standards
- `ARC-*-REQ-*.md` in `projects/{project-dir}/` — Requirements specification
  - Extract: BR/FR/NFR/INT/DR IDs, priorities, acceptance criteria — source of truth for DOS
  - If missing: ERROR — run `/arckit.requirements` first to define project needs

**RECOMMENDED** (read if available, note if missing):
- `ARC-*-STKE-*.md` in `projects/{project-dir}/` — Stakeholder analysis
  - Extract: User personas, business drivers, evaluation priorities
  - If missing: WARN — consider running `/arckit.stakeholders` to understand stakeholder priorities
- `ARC-*-RSCH-*.md` or `ARC-*-AWSR-*.md` or `ARC-*-AZUR-*.md` in `projects/{project-dir}/` — Technology research
  - Extract: Technology decisions informing essential skills requirements

**OPTIONAL** (read if available, skip silently if missing):
- `ARC-*-SOW-*.md` in `projects/{project-dir}/` — Statement of Work
  - Extract: Additional procurement context, scope definitions
- `ARC-*-RISK-*.md` in `projects/{project-dir}/` — Risk register
  - Extract: Risks requiring vendor mitigation, compliance requirements

**What to extract from each document**:
- **Principles**: Technology standards, governance constraints for vendor proposals
- **Requirements**: All BR/FR/NFR/INT/DR IDs with MUST/SHOULD/MAY priority
- **Stakeholders**: User personas, business drivers, evaluation priorities
- **Research**: Technology landscape informing essential skills

### 1b. Check for External Documents (optional)

Scan for external (non-ArcKit) documents the user may have provided:

**Contractor CVs & Previous DOS Submissions**:
- **Look in**: `projects/{project-dir}/external/`
- **File types**: PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), Markdown (.md)
- **What to extract**: Team capability evidence, previous submission scores, buyer requirements, evaluation feedback
- **Examples**: `team-cvs.pdf`, `previous-dos-submission.docx`, `buyer-requirements.pdf`

**User prompt**: If no external DOS docs found but they would improve the submission, ask:
\"Do you have any contractor CVs, previous DOS submissions, or buyer requirement documents? I can read PDFs directly. Place them in `projects/{project-dir}/external/` and re-run, or skip.\"

**Important**: This command works without external documents. They enhance output quality but are never blocking.

### 2. Load Project Context

Run `.arckit/scripts/bash/list-projects.sh --json` to get available projects, then:

1. Read `projects/[project]/ARC-*-REQ-v*.md` (source of truth)
2. Read `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` (governance constraints)
3. Read `projects/[project]/ARC-*-STKE-v*.md` if available (priorities)
4. Parse user input for additional context (budget, timeline, specific skills)

Related Arc-kit Commands:
- /arckit.evaluate - Create vendor evaluation framework after receiving proposals
- /arckit.hld-review - Set up HLD review process for vendor deliverables
- /arckit.dld-review - Set up DLD review process for vendor deliverables
- /arckit.traceability - Validate requirements traceability with vendor

Important: Maintain audit trail of all procurement decisions per Digital Marketplace requirements.
```

## Key Principles

2. **Requirements First**: Always pull from ARC-*-REQ-*.md - don't invent new requirements
3. **Principle Enforcement**: Ensure architecture principles constrain vendor proposals
4. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Reflect stakeholder priorities in evaluation criteria
5. **Technology-Agnostic**: Remove all implementation details from procurement docs
6. **Traceability**: Maintain requirement IDs (BR-xxx, FR-xxx, NFR-xxx, INT-xxx, DR-xxx) throughout
7. **Audit-Ready**: Structure supports Digital Marketplace audit requirements
8. **Gov.uk Aligned**: Use official terminology and link to authoritative guidance
9. **DOS-Focused**: This is ONLY for custom development - no G-Cloud content

## Error Handling

- **No principles**: ERROR \"Run /arckit.principles first - governance standards required\"
- **No requirements**: ERROR \"Run /arckit.requirements first - nothing to procure\"
- **No project**: Suggest project creation with `.arckit/scripts/bash/create-project.sh`
- **Wrong framework**: If user mentions G-Cloud or cloud services, suggest `/arckit.gcloud-search` instead
