Perform comprehensive governance quality analysis across architecture artifacts (requirements, principles, designs, assessments)
"""
prompt = """
## User Input

```text
{{args}}
```

## Goal

Identify inconsistencies, gaps, ambiguities, and compliance issues across all architecture governance artifacts before implementation or procurement. This command performs **non-destructive analysis** and produces a structured report saved to the project directory for tracking and audit purposes.

## Operating Constraints

**Non-Destructive Analysis**: Do **not** modify existing artifacts. Generate a comprehensive analysis report and save it to the project directory for tracking, sharing, and audit trail.

**Architecture Principles Authority**: The architecture principles (`ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` in `projects/000-global/`) are **non-negotiable**. Any conflicts with principles are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of requirements, designs, or vendor proposals—not dilution or reinterpretation of the principles.

**UK Government Compliance Authority** (if applicable): TCoP, AI Playbook, and ATRS compliance are mandatory for UK government projects. Non-compliance is CRITICAL.

## Execution Steps

### 0. Read the Template

**Read the template** (with user override support):
- **First**, check if `.arckit/templates-custom/analysis-report-template.md` exists (user override)
- **If found**: Read the user's customized template
- **If not found**: Read `.arckit/templates/analysis-report-template.md` (default)

> **Note**: Read the `VERSION` file and update the version in the template metadata line when generating.
> **Tip**: Users can customize templates with `/arckit.customize analyze`

### 1. Discover Project Context

Identify the project directory to analyze:
- If user specifies project: Use specified project directory
- If only one project exists: Analyze that project
- If multiple projects: Ask user which project to analyze

## Recommendations

### Critical Actions (MUST resolve before implementation/procurement)

1. **[P1] Add Cloud-First architecture**: Current design violates Cloud-First principle. Redesign with AWS/Azure/GCP.
2. **[R1] Cover security requirements**: NFR-S-003, NFR-S-007, NFR-S-012 have no design coverage. Add security architecture to HLD.
3. **[UK1] Complete DPIA**: HIGH-RISK AI system requires completed DPIA before deployment (AI Playbook MANDATORY).

### High Priority Actions (SHOULD resolve before implementation/procurement)

1. **[T1] Document API contracts**: Add OpenAPI specifications for all REST APIs.
2. **[T2] Add performance architecture**: NFR-P-002 (10K TPS) not addressed in design. Add performance section to HLD.
3. **[V1] Update SOW acceptance criteria**: Deliverable 3 acceptance criteria too vague. Add measurable criteria.

### Medium Priority Actions (Improve quality)

1. **[Q1] Consolidate duplicate requirements**: Merge NFR-S-001 and NFR-S-005 (identical).
2. **[Q2] Fix terminology drift**: \"User\" vs \"Customer\" used inconsistently. Standardize.
3. **[D1] Complete traceability matrix**: Add backward traceability from tests to requirements.

### Low Priority Actions (Optional improvements)

1. **[S1] Improve requirement wording**: Replace \"fast\" with measurable criteria (e.g., \"< 200ms p95\").
2. **[S2] Add edge case documentation**: Document edge cases for error handling.

## Detailed Findings

(Expand top findings with examples and specific recommendations)

### Finding R1: Duplicate Security Requirements (HIGH)

**Location**: `ARC-*-REQ-*.md:L45-52` and `ARC-*-REQ-*.md:L120-125`

**Details**:
```
NFR-S-001: System MUST encrypt data at rest using AES-256
NFR-S-005: All stored data SHALL be encrypted with AES-256 encryption
```

**Issue**: These are duplicate requirements with inconsistent language (MUST vs SHALL).

**Impact**: Confuses implementation team, wastes evaluation points in vendor scoring.

**Recommendation**:
1. Keep NFR-S-001 (clearer wording)
2. Delete NFR-S-005
3. Update traceability matrix

**Estimated Effort**: 10 minutes

---

### Finding P1: Violates Cloud-First Principle (CRITICAL)

**Location**: `ARC-*-REQ-*.md:L120`, Architecture Principles violation

**Details**:
```
FR-025: System SHALL deploy to on-premise servers in corporate datacenter
```

**Issue**: Violates \"Cloud-First\" architecture principle defined in `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md`. Principle states \"MUST use public cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP) unless explicitly justified exception.\"

**Impact**: Architecture doesn't align with organization standards. Blocks procurement approval.

**Recommendation**:
1. Change FR-025 to require AWS/Azure/GCP deployment
2. OR: Document formal exception with justification (security, regulatory, etc.)
3. Get exception approved by Architecture Review Board

**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours (requirement change + design update)

### 8. Provide Remediation Guidance

After outputting the report, ask:

> **Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation steps for the top {N} critical/high priority issues?**
>
> I can provide:
> 1. Specific edits to fix requirements
> 2. Design review guidance
> 3. Command sequences to address gaps
> 4. Templates for missing artifacts
>
> (I will NOT make changes automatically - you must approve each action)

## Operating Principles

### Context Efficiency

- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis
- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow
- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Guidelines

- **DO NOT modify existing artifacts** (non-destructive analysis)
- **DO write analysis report** to `projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ANAL-v1.0.md`
- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)
- **Prioritize principle violations** (these are always CRITICAL)
- **Prioritize UK Gov compliance issues** (mandatory for public sector)
- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)
- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with metrics)
- **Be specific**: Cite line numbers, requirement IDs, exact quotes
- **Be actionable**: Every finding should have a clear recommendation
- **Be fair**: Flag real issues, not nitpicks

### Enterprise Architecture Focus

Unlike Spec Kit's focus on code implementation, ArcKit analyze focuses on:
- **Governance compliance**: Principles, standards, policies
- **Requirements quality**: Completeness, testability, traceability
- **Procurement readiness**: SOW quality, vendor evaluation fairness
- **Design alignment**: Requirements → design traceability
- **UK Government compliance**: TCoP, AI Playbook, ATRS (if applicable)
- **Security & compliance**: Not just mentioned, but architected
- **Decision quality**: Objective, defensible, auditable

## Example Usage

User: `/arckit.analyze`

You should:
1. Identify project (if multiple, ask which)
2. Load artifacts progressively:
   - Architecture principles
   - Stakeholder drivers (if exists - RECOMMENDED)
   - Risk register (if exists - RECOMMENDED)
   - SOBC business case (if exists - RECOMMENDED)
   - Requirements (BR, FR, NFR, INT, DR)
   - Data model (if exists - RECOMMENDED if DR-xxx)
   - Designs (HLD, DLD)
   - UK Gov assessments (TCoP, AI Playbook, ATRS)
   - MOD assessment (SbD with CAAT)
   - Traceability matrix
3. Run detection passes:
   - Requirements quality (duplication, ambiguity, underspecification)
   - Stakeholder traceability (requirements to goals, conflict resolution, RACI alignment)
   - Risk coverage (high/very high risks mitigated, risk-requirements alignment, risk-SOBC alignment)
   - Business case alignment (benefits to stakeholders, benefits to requirements, costs adequacy)
   - Data model consistency (DR-xxx to entities, data governance, design alignment)
   - Principles alignment (violations, coverage)
   - Traceability (coverage gaps, orphans)
   - UK Gov compliance (TCoP, AI Playbook, ATRS)
   - MOD compliance (7 SbD Principles, NIST CSF, CAAT, Three Lines of Defence)
   - Consistency (terminology, data model, tech stack)
   - Security & compliance coverage
4. Assign severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
5. Generate comprehensive report with:
   - Executive summary
   - Findings table
   - Coverage matrices
   - Stakeholder traceability analysis
   - Risk management analysis
   - Business case analysis
   - Data model analysis
   - UK Gov compliance dashboard
   - MOD compliance dashboard
   - Metrics dashboard
   - Next steps and recommendations
6. Ask if user wants remediation guidance

Example output: \"Architecture Governance Analysis Report\" with 18 findings (3 CRITICAL, 6 HIGH, 7 MEDIUM, 2 LOW), 87% requirements coverage, 92% stakeholder traceability, 85% risk mitigation, TCoP score 98/130 (75%), MOD SbD score 58/70 (83%), recommendation: \"Resolve 3 CRITICAL issues (1 stakeholder orphan, 2 high risks unmitgated) before procurement\"

## Important Notes

- This is **non-destructive analysis** - existing artifacts are not modified
- Analysis report is saved to `projects/{project-dir}/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-ANAL-v1.0.md` for audit trail
- Run `/arckit.analyze` after major changes to requirements, designs, or assessments
- Ideal times to run:
  - Before issuing SOW/RFP to vendors
  - After receiving vendor proposals
  - Before design review meetings
  - Before implementation kickoff
  - Before deployment to production
- Analysis identifies issues; you decide how to resolve them
- Re-run after fixing issues to verify improvements
- Target: 90%+ governance health score before proceeding
