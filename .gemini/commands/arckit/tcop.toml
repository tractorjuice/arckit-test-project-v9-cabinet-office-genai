# Technology Code of Practice Review

You are helping to conduct a **Technology Code of Practice (TCoP) review** for a UK Government technology project or programme.

## Context

The Technology Code of Practice is a set of 13 criteria to help government design, build and buy technology. It's used by the Digital Spend Control team to assess technology spending proposals.

**TCoP Reference**: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice

## Your Task

Generate a comprehensive TCoP review document by:

1. **Loading the template**: Use the TCoP review template from `.arckit/templates/tcop-review-template.md`
   > **Note**: Read the `VERSION` file and update the version in the template metadata line when generating.

2. **Understanding the project**: Based on the user's description and any existing project documentation (specs, architecture, requirements), assess compliance against all 13 TCoP points:
   - Point 1: Define user needs
   - Point 2: Make things accessible and inclusive
   - Point 3: Be open and use open source
   - Point 4: Make use of open standards
   - Point 5: Use cloud first
   - Point 6: Make things secure
   - Point 7: Make privacy integral
   - Point 8: Share, reuse and collaborate
   - Point 9: Integrate and adapt technology
   - Point 10: Make better use of data
   - Point 11: Define your purchasing strategy
   - Point 12: Make your technology sustainable
   - Point 13: Meet the Service Standard

3. **For each TCoP point**:
   - Assess status: ✅ Compliant / ⚠️ Partially Compliant / ❌ Non-Compliant / N/A Not Applicable
   - Provide evidence of how the project meets (or fails to meet) the criteria
   - Check relevant checklist items based on project information
   - Identify gaps and required actions

4. **Check for existing documentation**:
   - Look for requirements documents in `specs/*/requirements.md`
   - Look for architecture documents in `specs/*/diagrams/`
   - Look for any existing compliance documents
   - Use information from these documents to inform your assessment

5. **Provide realistic assessments**:
   - Be honest about compliance gaps
   - Mark items as \"Partially Compliant\" if only some aspects are met
   - Use \"N/A\" only when truly not applicable
   - Provide actionable recommendations for gaps

6. **Generate compliance scorecard**: Create a summary showing status of all 13 points

7. **Prioritize actions**: Identify critical issues requiring immediate attention

8. **Save the document**: Write to `specs/[project-folder]/tcop-review.md`




**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

### Step 1: Generate Document ID
```bash
# Use the ArcKit document ID generation script
DOC_ID=$(.arckit/scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh \"${PROJECT_ID}\" \"TCOP\" \"1.0\")
# Example output: ARC-001-TCOP-v1.0
```

### Step 2: Populate Required Fields

**Auto-populated fields** (populate these automatically):
- `[PROJECT_ID]` → Extract from project path (e.g., \"001\" from \"projects/001-project-name\")
- `[VERSION]` → Start with \"1.0\" for new documents
- `[DATE]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD]` → Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `[DOCUMENT_TYPE_NAME]` → Use the document purpose (e.g., \"Business and Technical Requirements\")
- `ARC-[PROJECT_ID]-TCOP-v[VERSION]` → Use generated DOC_ID from Step 1
- `[COMMAND]` → Current command name (e.g., \"arckit.tcop\")

**User-provided fields** (extract from project metadata or user input):
- `[PROJECT_NAME]` → Full project name from project metadata or user input
- `[OWNER_NAME_AND_ROLE]` → Document owner (prompt user if not in metadata)
- `[CLASSIFICATION]` → Default to \"OFFICIAL\" for UK Gov, \"PUBLIC\" otherwise (or prompt user)

**Calculated fields**:
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Current date + 30 days (requirements, research, risks)
- `[YYYY-MM-DD]` for Review Date → Phase gate dates (Alpha/Beta/Live for compliance docs)

**Pending fields** (leave as [PENDING] until manually updated):
- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to \"Project Team, Architecture Team\" or [PENDING]

### Step 3: Populate Revision History

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit.tcop` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

### Step 4: Populate Generation Metadata Footer

The footer should be populated with:
```markdown
**Generated by**: ArcKit `/arckit.tcop` command
**Generated on**: {DATE} {TIME} GMT
**ArcKit Version**: [Read from .arckit/VERSION file or use \"0.6.0\"]
**Project**: {PROJECT_NAME} (Project {PROJECT_ID})
**AI Model**: [Use actual model name, e.g., \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\"]
**Generation Context**: [Brief note about source documents used]
```

### Example Fully Populated Document Control Section:

```markdown
## Document Control

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Document ID** | ARC-001-TCOP-v1.0 |
| **Document Type** | {Document purpose} |
| **Project** | Windows 10 to Windows 11 Migration (Project 001) |
| **Classification** | OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE |
| **Status** | DRAFT |
| **Version** | 1.0 |
| **Created Date** | 2025-10-29 |
| **Last Modified** | 2025-10-29 |
| **Review Date** | 2025-11-30 |
| **Owner** | John Smith (Business Analyst) |
| **Reviewed By** | [PENDING] |
| **Approved By** | [PENDING] |
| **Distribution** | PM Team, Architecture Team, Dev Team |

## Revision History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes | Approved By | Approval Date |
|---------|------|--------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 1.0 | 2025-10-29 | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit.tcop` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```


## Output Format

The document must include:
- Executive summary with overall compliance status
- Detailed assessment for each of the 13 TCoP points
- Evidence and checklist items for each point
- Gaps and required actions
- Overall compliance scorecard (X/13 compliant)
- Critical issues list
- Prioritized recommendations (High/Medium/Low)
- Next steps with timeline
- Approval section

## Assessment Guidelines

**When assessing compliance**:

- **✅ Compliant**: Clear evidence exists, all key criteria met, no significant gaps
- **⚠️ Partially Compliant**: Some aspects addressed but significant gaps remain, or evidence is incomplete
- **❌ Non-Compliant**: Criteria not met, no evidence of compliance, or critical gaps exist
- **N/A**: Point is genuinely not applicable (e.g., Point 13 if not building a public service)

**Common critical issues**:
- No DPIA for projects processing personal data (Point 7)
- No accessibility testing for user-facing services (Point 2)
- No security assessment completed (Point 6)
- Public cloud not considered (Point 5)
- No user research conducted (Point 1)

**Project phases matter**:
- **Discovery/Alpha**: User research, technical spikes, open source exploration expected
- **Beta**: Accessibility testing, security assessments, DPIA should be complete
- **Live**: All 13 points must be fully compliant

## Special Considerations

**For AI/ML systems**: Also consider requirements from the AI Playbook (may need ATRS - Algorithmic Transparency Record)

**For public-facing services**: Point 13 (Service Standard) is mandatory - must pass GDS service assessments

**For Digital Spend Control submissions**: Focus on points most relevant to spending approval:
- Point 5 (Cloud First)
- Point 11 (Purchasing Strategy)
- Point 8 (Reuse and Collaboration)

**Data protection**: If processing personal data, Point 7 is critical - DPIA completion is mandatory before going live

## UK Government Context

Be aware of:
- **Digital Marketplace**: G-Cloud, DOS frameworks for procurement
- **GDS Service Standard**: 14-point standard for public services
- **NCSC guidance**: Cyber security best practices
- **UK GDPR**: Data protection requirements
- **Cyber Essentials**: Baseline security certification
- **Cloud First policy**: Public cloud preferred unless justified otherwise

```

## Notes

- Be thorough but practical - this is a governance document, not just a checkbox exercise
- Highlight blockers that prevent progression to next phase
- Reference official GOV.UK guidance URLs for each point
- Consider the project's maturity - don't expect Live compliance in Discovery
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations rather than generic advice
