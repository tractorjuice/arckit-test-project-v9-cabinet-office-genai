Find G-Cloud services on UK Digital Marketplace with live search and comparison
"""
prompt = """
You are helping an enterprise architect find and compare G-Cloud services on the UK Digital Marketplace.

## User Input

```text
{{args}}
```

## Context

**G-Cloud** is the UK Digital Marketplace framework for procuring off-the-shelf cloud services:
- Cloud hosting, IaaS, PaaS
- SaaS platforms and tools
- Cloud support services
- No custom development - just service procurement

This command:
1. Analyzes your project requirements to identify cloud service needs
2. Generates G-Cloud procurement requirements
3. **Searches the Digital Marketplace for matching services** (live search)
4. Compares services and provides recommendations

## Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites Check

**IMPORTANT**: Check prerequisites before proceeding:

a. **Project with Requirements** (MUST exist):
   - Check if user specified a project name/number
   - Look for `projects/[project]/ARC-*-REQ-v*.md`
   - If NOT found: ERROR \"Run /arckit.requirements first to define project needs\"

b. **Architecture Principles** (RECOMMENDED):
   - Check if `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` exists
   - If exists: Read it for cloud strategy, security requirements
   - If NOT found: WARN \"Consider running /arckit.principles to define cloud governance\"

### 2. Load Project Context

Run `.arckit/scripts/bash/list-projects.sh --json` to get available projects, then:

1. Read `projects/[project]/ARC-*-REQ-v*.md`
2. Read `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` if available
3. Parse user input for specific service types needed

### 3. Analyze Cloud Service Needs

**Scan requirements** to identify what cloud services are needed:

**Look for**:
- INT-xxx mentioning: \"cloud hosting\", \"SaaS\", \"IaaS\", \"PaaS\", \"monitoring\", \"email service\"
- NFR-xxx mentioning: \"uptime\", \"availability\", \"disaster recovery\", \"cloud infrastructure\"
- FR-xxx mentioning: \"platform\", \"service\", \"hosting\", \"managed service\"

**Service categories to identify**:
- **Cloud Hosting**: IaaS, VMs, containers, Kubernetes
- **Cloud Software**: SaaS platforms, tools, applications
- **Cloud Support**: Managed services, monitoring, backup
- **Specialized Services**: Email, CDN, databases, analytics

**Determine**:
- Primary service category needed
- Must-have requirements (from MUST priority)
- Desirable requirements (from SHOULD priority)
- Compliance needs (security certifications, data residency)

**CRITICAL - Auto-Populate Document Control Fields**:

Before completing the document, populate ALL document control fields in the header:

**Generate Document ID**:
```bash
# Use the ArcKit document ID generation script
DOC_ID=$(.arckit/scripts/bash/generate-document-id.sh \"${PROJECT_ID}\" \"GCLD\" \"${VERSION}\")
# Example output: ARC-001-GCLD-v1.0
```

- `[REVIEWER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[APPROVER_NAME]` → [PENDING]
- `[DISTRIBUTION_LIST]` → Default to \"Project Team, Architecture Team\" or [PENDING]

**Populate Revision History**:

```markdown
| 1.0 | {DATE} | ArcKit AI | Initial creation from `/arckit.gcloud-search` command | [PENDING] | [PENDING] |
```

**Populate Generation Metadata Footer**:

The footer should be populated with:

```

## Key Principles

1. **Live Search**: Always use WebSearch to find actual services - don't just generate requirements
2. **Requirements-Driven**: Build search queries from actual project requirements
3. **Comparison Focus**: Provide side-by-side comparison with clear recommendation
4. **Practical Links**: Include direct links to every service mentioned
5. **Gap Identification**: Clearly identify if services don't meet MUST requirements
6. **Actionable Output**: Next steps should be concrete and immediately actionable
7. **Traceability**: Maintain requirement IDs throughout evaluation

## Search Query Examples

**For Cloud Hosting**:
- `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud cloud hosting kubernetes docker`
- `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud iaas virtual machines linux`
- `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud paas cloud platform managed`

**For SaaS Platforms**:
- `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud monitoring observability prometheus`
- `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud email delivery service smtp`
- `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud ci cd pipeline automation`
- `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud analytics data warehouse`

**For Specialized Services**:
- `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud cdn content delivery network`
- `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud backup disaster recovery`
- `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud security scanning vulnerability`

## Error Handling

- **No requirements**: ERROR \"Run /arckit.requirements first - need to define service needs\"
- **Custom development detected**: ERROR \"This is for custom development - use /arckit.dos instead\"
- **No service needs found**: WARN \"No cloud service requirements found - are you sure this is G-Cloud procurement?\"
- **No search results**: Suggest broader search terms, provide manual search guidance
- **Few search results (1-2)**: Show what was found, suggest alternative searches

## G-Cloud vs DOS Guidance

If requirements suggest custom development rather than cloud services:
```
⚠️ FRAMEWORK MISMATCH DETECTED

Your requirements suggest custom development (FR-xxx functional requirements for building features).

G-Cloud is for buying off-the-shelf cloud services, not custom development.

✅ Use /arckit.dos instead - Digital Outcomes and Specialists

DOS is the correct framework for:
- Custom software development
- Building new systems
- Hiring developers/specialists
- Project outcomes that require custom implementation

Only use /arckit.gcloud-search if you need:
- Cloud hosting or infrastructure (IaaS/PaaS)
- Off-the-shelf SaaS platforms
- Managed cloud services
```
