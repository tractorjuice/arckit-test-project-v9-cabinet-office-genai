description: Generate Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS) procurement documentation for UK Digital Marketplace
---

You are helping an enterprise architect prepare Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS) procurement documentation for the UK Digital Marketplace.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Context

**Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS)** is the UK Digital Marketplace framework for:
- Custom software development
- Hiring developers, architects, designers, and technical specialists
- Delivering specific digital project outcomes

This command generates DOS-compliant procurement documentation from your existing arc-kit project requirements.

## Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites Check

**IMPORTANT**: Check prerequisites before proceeding:

a. **Architecture Principles** (MUST exist):
   - Check if `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` exists
   - If NOT found: ERROR "Run /arckit.principles first to define governance standards"

b. **Project with Requirements** (MUST exist):
   - Check if user specified a project name/number
   - Look for `projects/[project]/ARC-*-REQ-v*.md`
   - If NOT found: ERROR "Run /arckit.requirements first to define project needs"

c. **Stakeholder Analysis** (RECOMMENDED):
   - Check if `projects/[project]/ARC-*-STKE-v*.md` exists
   - If NOT found: WARN "Consider running /arckit.stakeholders to understand stakeholder priorities"
   - If exists: Read it to inform procurement priorities

d. **Existing SOW** (OPTIONAL):
   - Check if `projects/[project]/ARC-*-SOW-v*.md` exists
   - If exists: Reference it for additional context
   - This command generates Digital Marketplace-specific docs alongside general SOW

### 2. Load Project Context

Run `.arckit/scripts/bash/list-projects.sh --json` to get available projects, then:

1. Read `projects/[project]/ARC-*-REQ-v*.md` (source of truth)
2. Read `projects/000-global/ARC-000-PRIN-*.md` (governance constraints)
3. Read `projects/[project]/ARC-*-STKE-v*.md` if available (priorities)
4. Parse user input for additional context (budget, timeline, specific skills)

### 3. Generate DOS Procurement Documentation

Create directory: `projects/[project]/procurement/`

Generate `projects/[project]/procurement/ARC-{PROJECT_ID}-DOS-v1.0.md`:

```markdown

Related Arc-kit Commands:
- /arckit.evaluate - Create vendor evaluation framework after receiving proposals
- /arckit.hld-review - Set up HLD review process for vendor deliverables
- /arckit.dld-review - Set up DLD review process for vendor deliverables
- /arckit.traceability - Validate requirements traceability with vendor

Important: Maintain audit trail of all procurement decisions per Digital Marketplace requirements.
```

## Key Principles

1. **Requirements First**: Always pull from ARC-*-REQ-*.md - don't invent new requirements
2. **Principle Enforcement**: Ensure architecture principles constrain vendor proposals
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Reflect stakeholder priorities in evaluation criteria
4. **Technology-Agnostic**: Remove all implementation details from procurement docs
5. **Traceability**: Maintain requirement IDs (BR-xxx, FR-xxx, NFR-xxx, INT-xxx, DR-xxx) throughout
6. **Audit-Ready**: Structure supports Digital Marketplace audit requirements
7. **Gov.uk Aligned**: Use official terminology and link to authoritative guidance
8. **DOS-Focused**: This is ONLY for custom development - no G-Cloud content

## Error Handling

- **No principles**: ERROR "Run /arckit.principles first - governance standards required"
- **No requirements**: ERROR "Run /arckit.requirements first - nothing to procure"
- **No project**: Suggest project creation with `.arckit/scripts/bash/create-project.sh`
- **Wrong framework**: If user mentions G-Cloud or cloud services, suggest `/arckit.gcloud-search` instead
